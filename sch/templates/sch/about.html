    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>It is often difficult for parents to search for a suitable school for their children that fits their criteria.
        This problem often occurs with parents that move into a new locality they are unfamiliar with. Parents have
        different requirements and expectations for selecting a school for their children. For example academic
        excellence, extra curricular activities, distance from home, travel facilities, boarding requirements, fees,
        board etc.
        The aim of this system is to recommend schools that meet those requirements given the data they have provided.
        This recommendation will be primarily focused on reputation and academic excellence. Other criteria can be
        filtered out based on parents requirements that includes board, location, fees, extra curricular activities,
        facilities and discipline.
        Parents will have to provide with their basic information like email, address etc. The system will filter the
        option based on data and the recommend top schools that have good reputation and academic excellence, based on
        the city and the area they give. They will then see a list of schools along with some filtering options like
        gender the school is allowing, board the school has affiliated to, different facilities that the school have for
        eg. AC Classrooms, swimming pool etc. Parents can then filter and narrow down their options to based on the
        requirements as given.
        In order to improve the service, the users can also write detailed review based on their experience in school
        and give a rating on different criteria based on requirements and facilities.
